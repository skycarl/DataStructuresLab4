# DataStructuresLab4
This program accepts input files containing integers and sorts them using quicksort and heapsort algorithms. Statistics are then printed to an output file. 

####**Input**  
The user must specify 2 runtime parameters: the name of the file containing filenames of all input files, and the desired name of the output file. Input files must be held in a folder in the root project directory titled "input". The input files must have one value on each line. 
 
Note: input files are assumed to be UTF-8 encoded. Unexpected behavior may occur if others are used.


####**Execution**
The program may be compiled and run from the command line or terminal as such:    
javac Lab4.java  
java Lab4 inputFiles.txt summaryData.txt
